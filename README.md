<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>There are many different TV apps all over the web, but I didn't like any of them. I created this to practice my React.js skills and to make something that I would use in my daily life.</p>
<h3>Features: </h3>

- Search page to find anything TV.
- A watchlist to keep track of the movies that you want to watch and have watched.

<p>The project is not done yet, and I dont envision it being done for a little while. There will always be changes being added as I learn new things.</p>
